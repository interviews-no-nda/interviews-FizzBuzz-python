## Requirements:
Write a Python program that iterates the integers from *1 to 50*. For multiples of *three* print *"Fizz"* instead of the number and for multiples of *five* print *"Buzz"*. 

For numbers that are multiples of three and five, print *"FizzBuzz"*

### Additional requireemnts
Provide an easy way to change the rules of FizzBuss:
- change the dividers instead or in addition to *3* and *5*
- change the text equivalents for dividers instead or in addition to *"Fizz"* and *"Buzz"*
- change the integers range to any range of positive integers

## Instructions:
Please provide the code, any workings and the expected output
